# Smart Study Planner

A small client-side web app (HTML/CSS/JS) that helps students create and manage study tasks, track progress, and view a 7-day visual timeline.

Features:
- Add tasks with title, subject, due date/time, priority, and optional reminders (while page is open).
- Tasks are persisted in browser `localStorage`.
- Export and import tasks as JSON.
- Simple 7-day timeline view.
- Delete tasks and mark as done.


Note: Reminders only work when the page is open (this is a browser limitation for simple client-side apps).
